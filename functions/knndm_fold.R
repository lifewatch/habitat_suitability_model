#' Create K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Disaggregated Model (KNNDM) Folds
#'
#' This function generates cross-validation folds using the KNNDM approach. It partitions the training data into folds based on the feature space of the environmental predictors, leveraging hierarchical clustering and the KNN disaggregation method.
#'
#' @param train_data A data frame containing training data, including `occurrence_status` and the environmental covariates.
#' @param prediction_layers A `SpatRasterDataset` (SDS) object representing the environmental layers used for prediction.
#' @param n_folds An integer specifying the number of folds for cross-validation. Default is 5.
#' @return A list containing:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{knndm_folds}: The KNNDM object, including the indices of training and testing points for each fold.
#'   \item \code{rsample_folds}: A `rsample` object with manual resampling folds.
#' }
#' @details This function:
#'          1. Calculates the mean feature space of the environmental layers to construct a predictive space.
#'          2. Uses the KNNDM approach to cluster data points in the feature space.
#'          3. Creates `rsample` folds with training and assessment splits for each fold.
#' 
#' The KNNDM approach leverages hierarchical clustering (`ward.D2`) in feature space and Fibonacci sampling to ensure balanced data partitions.

#' prediction_layers <- terra::sds(thetao_avg_m, so_avg_m, npp_avg_m, bathy)
#' names(prediction_layers) <- c("thetao", "so", "npp", "bathy")
